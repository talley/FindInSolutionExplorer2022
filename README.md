# Find in Solution Explorer extension for Visual Studio 2022

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0it4grdxq15jrp2w/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sharwell/findinsolutionexplorer/branch/master)

This simple extension adds a new **Find In Solution Explorer** item to the context menu of document tabs for documents open in the editor, positioned between the **Copy Full Path** and **Open Containing Folder** commands. This command is especially useful when working with large projects.

This extension duplicates a feature provided by a different extension I released a few years ago to a small number of people. If you already have a **Find In Solution Explorer** menu item on the document tabs, then you probably don't need this one since it does the same thing.

:bulb: This extension is somewhat obsolete because the updated **Solution Explorer** includes a button on its tool bar for the **Sync with Active Document** command and the default shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>.
